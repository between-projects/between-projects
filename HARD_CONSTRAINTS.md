# Lookout — Hard Constraints

These constraints override convenience, optimization, and feature expansion.
They exist to protect calm.

1. No notifications of any kind (visual, audible, background).
2. No numeric summaries, counts, badges, or streaks in the primary view.
3. No backlog, history, or past-due surfacing in the primary view.
4. No urgency coloring (red/yellow/green) anywhere.
5. No gamification, rewards, or habit enforcement mechanics.
6. No AI language or AI presence in the user interface.
7. No feeds, infinite scrolls, or engagement loops.
8. No reordering content to drive behavior.
9. The primary view must remain sparse; density increases are forbidden.
10. If a feature increases anxiety, it must be removed.

If an implementation choice violates any of the above, it is incorrect.
