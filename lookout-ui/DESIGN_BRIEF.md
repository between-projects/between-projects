# Lookout
## A Personal Operating System


### Operating Brief


## Purpose
For years, I've been moving between complicated Notion setups and a plain Google Doc to keep track of my projects and tasks. For reference, here's the most recent month's planner. I currently do one of these, along with a Scratch Paper doc where I keep notes, links of interest, quotes, etc

It works well for me, but I would love something more intuitive, automated, connected, and ambient. If successful, this application should eventually become the central system of my life and work, a tool that always lets me know the next action, appointment, and what I need to complete major projects. It should also provide clear indicators of progress on my major goals and projects. I will trust this system if it reduces the amount of work and information I carry in my head.

The system may suggest a next action, but it never insists. It should feel like a gentle hand, not a command.


## What It Is:
- Calm Machine
- Focus Apparatus
- Planner
- Task Manager
- Calendar
- Clock
- Organizing System
- Navigation System
- Library of notation
- Outlet for Expression
- Means to manage, curate, and notate your life and work


## What It Is Not:
- "Productivity Software"
- Too complicated to use
- Too simple to be effective
- Social media
- Algorithmically tainted
- Not optimized for speed
- Not real-time collaborative
- Not notification-driven
- Not a feed
- Not habit enforcement
- Not AI-forward in presentation


## Aesthetic Inputs:
I want it to look and feel like the Sister City website
See attached images

I always loved the Chill / Calm / Ambient vibe of this now closed Ace Hotel property—the brand, the hotel design, and the way the room felt. It was only open for about a year before COVID claimed it. I stayed there in 2019 and wrote about it here. It represents a space that existed where I was most happy in terms of creative/solitary bliss.

So in essence, it's a digital home for what comes next—appointments, projects, and tasks —that also allows me to capture ideas, notes, links, images, and other digital ephemera that connect to my calendar, Google Drive, and other tools.

In terms of the design system, I want simple type — Helvetica Neue or another simple grotesk paired with IBM Plex Mono — with a nice blue gradient background, and the system's modules should be very minimal and clean. Later I would like to figure out a way to use the current color of the sky and the position of the sun to generate BG color.

I can see it in my head. If it's important for me to get it right or it's above the capability of current tools to get it right, I could generate concepts and systems in Figma that we can connect in through MCP.


## Primary Mode
This system is open throughout the day. It's a guide and a working tool.
- It defaults to today, not the future
- It never opens to a backlog
- It assumes I am human, not optimized

This helps prevent the system from becoming:
- a task warehouse
- an anxiety mirror


## Progress Signals
- Progress is measured weekly, not hourly
- Signals should feel reflective, not evaluative
- Trend > completion
- Presence > throughput


## Tools and Possible Connections:
- Location
- Clock
- Time / Weather
- Date
- Appointments
- Tasks
- Motivational quote
- Notes
- Interesting links


## Visual Presentation:
Generate the following text:

> Good Morning, Jonah. It's x:xx xM and xx F outside.
>
> Would you like to do a deep dive on your appointments, tasks, semester goals or notes?
>
> Here's your Day At A Glance

Then boxes for all of the components listed above.
